# Here's an example for Annika.

This is a sample blog post showing how to structure markdown files for your static site generator. Here's what makes it work:

## Key Components

1. **Frontmatter**: The section at the top between `---` lines contains important metadata
2. **Content**: Everything after the frontmatter is your actual blog post content

## Markdown Features

You can use all standard markdown features:

- Lists like this one
- **Bold text**
- *Italic text*
- [Links](https://example.com)
- And more!

## What's Next?

Once you have this working, you can create as many blog posts as you want using this same structure.
